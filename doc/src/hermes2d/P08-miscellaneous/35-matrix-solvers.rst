Using Matrix Solvers (35-matrix-solvers)
----------------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `35-matrix-solvers <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/tree/HEAD:/hermes2d/tutorial/P08-miscellaneous/35-matrix-solvers>`_. 

This example shows how to solve a matrix problem Ax = b in Hermes using various solvers
that Hermes supports. The matrix and the right-hand side vector are first read from a text 
file into coordinate matrix structures, then passed into a SparseMatrix and Vector structures, 
and finally solved using a LinearSolver of the user's choice.

To use a solver, Hermes2D must be compiled with this solver enabled. This is done via
compilation flags WITH_PETSC, WITH_UMFPACK, WITH_TRILINOS (for AztecOO and Amesos),
WITH_MUMPS and WITH_SUPERLU that are set to default values in CMakeLists.txt. To change these settings, 
use the CMake.vars file. For example, a line "set(WITH_MUMPS YES)" will override the 
default value for the Mumps solver.

**Usage:**

There are two available solver options: real and complex one.
The distinction between these two is in system matrix and right hand side vector entries they handle.

Typical usage of matrix solvers would look like this:

    matrix-solvers <matrix_solver> <input_text_file_with_matrix_and_vector> 

**Available solvers:** petsc, petsc-block, umfpack, umfpack-block,  aztecoo, 
aztecoo-block, amesos, amesos-block, mumps, mumps-block, superlu, superlu-block.

**Available input files:** linsys-1.txt, linsys-2.txt, linsys-3.txt,
linsys-cplx-4.txt, linsys-cplx-hermitian-5.txt, linsys-cplx-nonhermitian-6.txt

but the user can of course provide his/her own. In the input file, the first number is the 
matrix/vector size, followed by a number of non zero matrix entries, starting from the next line matrix and the right-hand side 
vector in the coordinate format are given. For example the file linsys-3.txt contains::

    5
    12
    0 0 2
    0 1 3
    1 0 3
    1 2 4
    1 4 6
    2 1 -1
    2 2 -3
    2 3 2
    3 2 1
    4 1 4
    4 2 2
    4 4 1

    0 8
    1 45
    2 -3
    3 3
    4 19

Output::

    I Setting matrix element (0, 0, 2).
    I Setting matrix element (0, 1, 3).
    I Setting matrix element (1, 0, 3).
    I Setting matrix element (1, 2, 4).
    I Setting matrix element (1, 4, 6).
    I Setting matrix element (2, 1, -1).
    I Setting matrix element (2, 2, -3).
    I Setting matrix element (2, 3, 2).
    I Setting matrix element (3, 2, 1).
    I Setting matrix element (4, 1, 4).
    I Setting matrix element (4, 2, 2).
    I Setting matrix element (4, 4, 1).
    I Setting vector entry (0, 8).
    I Setting vector entry (1, 45).
    I Setting vector entry (2, -3).
    I Setting vector entry (3, 3).
    I Setting vector entry (4, 19).
    I Matrix solve successful.
    Solution vector: 1 2 3 4 5 

**Solving complex valued linear systems with real solver:**

Matrix solvers in Hermes have the capability of solving complex valued linear systems with real solvers. It is achieved by 
transforming the original complex matrix to equivalent real fomulation. In Hermes this is simply done by adding additional command line argument:

    matrix-solvers <matrix_solver> <input_text_file_with_matrix_and_vector> complex-matrix-to-real

An example call looks like this:

    P10-40-matrix-solvers-real aztecoo linsys-cplx-4.txt complex-matrix-to-real

Which generates following output::

    I Matrix solve successful.
    Solution vector: 
    0.800000
    0.470588
    0.486486
    -0.600000
    -0.882353
    -0.918919

A complex solver call with the same input file:

    P10-40-matrix-solvers-cplx aztecoo linsys-cplx-4.txt

Generates following output::

    I Matrix solve successful.
    Solution vector: 
    (0.800000, -0.600000)
    (0.470588, -0.882353)
    (0.486486, -0.918919)
