Smooth-aniso-y (Elliptic)
-------------------------

**Git reference:** Benchmark `smooth-aniso-y <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/tree/HEAD:/hermes2d/benchmarks-general/smooth-aniso-y>`_.

This example is very similar to the previous one, except now the solution is 
constant in the x-direction. It is good to have both to be able to check that 
anisotropic refinements work correctly.
