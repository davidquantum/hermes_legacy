Tutorial Part IV (Automatic Adaptivity)
=======================================

So far we have not paid much attention to the accuracy of results. In general, 
a computation on a fixed mesh is not likely to be very accurate. There is a need 
for *adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)* that improves the quality of the approximation 
by refining mesh elements or increases the polynomial degree where the approximation 
error is large.
