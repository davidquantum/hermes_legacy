Model problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, the previous two examples are combined together -- we use the same model
problem and perform adaptivity in space in combination with adaptive time stepping.
The adaptive time stepping can be turned off either by setting ADAPTIVE_TIME_STEP_ON = false
or by selecting a non-embedded Runge-Kutta method.

Adaptive algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The algorithm is just a merge of the adaptivity 
algorithms from the previous two examples. 
Each time step begins with a uniform mesh 
derefinement that can be done in three possible 
ways. Inside the time stepping loop, a standard 
spatial adaptivity loop takes place.
