Hermes follows the mathematical concept of FEM closely -- after creating a mesh,
in the next step one needs to construct a finite element space on it.

Spaces available in Hermes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following predefined spaces are currently available:

* H1Space - the most common space of continuous, piecewise-polynomial functions belonging to $H^1(\Omega) = \{ v \in L^2(\Omega); \nabla u \in [L^2(\Omega)]^2 \}$,
* HcurlSpace - space of vector-valued functions discontinuous along mesh edges, with continuous tangential component on the edges $H(\mbox{curl},\Omega) = \{ E \in [L^2(\Omega)]^2; \nabla \times E \in L^2(\Omega)\}$,
* HdivSpace - space of vector-valued functions discontinuous along mesh edges, with continuous normal component on the edges $H(\mbox{div},\Omega) = \{ v \in [L^2(\Omega)^2; \nabla \cdot v \in L^2(\Omega)\}$,
* L2Space - space of functions discontinuous along mesh edges, belonging to the space $L^2(\Omega)$.

All these spaces allow for higher-order elements, meshes with arbitrary-level hanging nodes,
and automatic *hp*-adaptivity. 

Structure of higher-order basis functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us talk about the $H^1$ space for a moment. Besides the standard (bi)linear vertex
functions ("pyramids") 
that form standard low-order FEM approximations, the space can contain
quadratic, cubic, etc., *edge functions* that generate higher-degree
polynomials along mesh edges, and *bubble functions* that complete the higher-order
approximation in element interiors. Vertex functions are associated with mesh vertices,
edge functions with mesh edges, and bubble functions with element interiors. The next 
figure shows a higher-order edge function (left) and a higher-order bubble function 
(right).

Higher-order basis functions can be defined in many different ways. 
A particular set of polynomials is called *shapeset*. Using a good shapeset is crucial for the
performance of the *hp*-FEM. No shapeset can be optimal for all possible operators.
Therefore, Hermes offers several shapesets from which
you need to choose one when creating a FE space. The ones which perform best
in most computations (according to our experience) are simply called
H1Shapeset, HcurlShapeset, HdivShapeset and L2Shapeset.
Others can be found in the directory `src/shapeset/ <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/tree/HEAD:/hermes2d/src/shapeset>`_. 

Example
~~~~~~~

Up to some comments, the following is the complete
`main.cpp <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/blob/HEAD:/hermes2d/tutorial/P01-linear/02-space/main.cpp>`_ file
of the example 02-space::


    const int P_INIT = 3;

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      // Load the mesh.
      Mesh mesh;
      H2DReader mloader;
      mloader.load("domain.mesh", &mesh);            // original L-shape domain

      // Refine all elements (optional).
      mesh.refine_all_elements();

      // Create an H1 space with default shapeset and natural BC.
      H1Space space(&mesh, P_INIT);

      // View FE basis functions.
      BaseView bview("FE Space", new WinGeom(0, 0, 440, 350));
      bview.fix_scale_width(50);
      bview.show(&space);

      // Practice some keyboard and mouse controls.
      printf("%s", text);

      // Wait for the view to be closed.
      View::wait();
      return 0;
    }

Initializing a Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An instance of H1Space is initialized with two or three arguments: 

* Pointer to a mesh. 
* Pointer to the EssentialBCs class (if essential boundary 
  conditions are used). This will be illustrated in the next 
  example 03-poisson.
* Uniform initial polynomial degree of all mesh elements.

For reference, by *essential* boundary conditions we mean conditions 
that remove degrees of freedom from the boundary, such as Dirichlet 
conditions for $H^1$ problems of perfect conductor conditions in the
space H(curl). Boundary conditions that leave the solution 
values on the boundary unknown are called *natural*. These are 
for example Neumann or Newton (Robin) conditions in $H^1$ or 
impedance conditions in H(curl).

Setting element orders individually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Polynomial degrees of elements can also be set individually by calling 
the method Space::set_element_order() or for all elements at once using
Space::set_uniform_order(). Note that element degrees
are stored in Space, not in Mesh. The reason is that in Hermes one can
have multiple spaces with different element degrees and even types 
over the same mesh. In Hermes, Mesh only stores geometrical information.
A space created in this way is ready for use. 

Visualizing basis functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a debugging/learning feature, Hermes can visualize the basis of each Space.
Similarly to MeshView, one can create a BaseView object and use it 
to display the entire basis (VectorBaseView has to be used for vector-valued 
approximations in spaces Hcurl and Hdiv - this will be discussed later). 
One can cycle through all basis functions in the window using the arrow keys. 
If you press the left mouse button at the beginning, you will see the Dirichlet 
lift (a function that represents Dirichlet boundary conditions).

3D view
~~~~~~~

This is how the last figure above was obtained (press the '3' key for 3D mode).
We suggest that you spend some time experimenting with element refinements and 
hanging nodes to see how basis functions on irregular meshes look like.
